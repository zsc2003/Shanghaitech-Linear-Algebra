系数矩阵 $A$ and 增广矩阵 $\bar{A}=(A|\mathbf{b})$

# 初等行变换
- 交换两行
- 用一个非零常数乘以某一行
- 用一个非零常数乘以某一行，然后加到另一行上

> 注意化简矩阵的时候的符号写法, 写出矩阵的化简方式

## row echelon form(行阶梯矩阵)
- leading 1(首1/主1/主元......)
- Any row in the matrix that is 0 must be below the row that is not 0
- upper row's leading 1 must be to the left of the lower row's leading 1

## reduced row echelon form(简化行阶梯矩阵)

- The leading 1 contained in any row of the matrix that is not 0 is the only term in the column that is not 0

# Gauss elimination
1. no solution
2. fixed solution
3. infinite solutions

# leading variable & free variable

$B$ is an augmented matrix of a linear system, its row echelon form is $\tilde{B}$

The unknowns corresponding to the leading 1 in the rows that are not 0 in $\tilde{B}$ are called the **leading variables** of the system of equations, and all the unknowns other than the leading variables are called the **free variables** of the system of equations.
