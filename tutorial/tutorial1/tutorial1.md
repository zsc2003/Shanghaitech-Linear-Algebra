- Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations.
- It is a fundamental mathematical subject with applications in many fields.
- It is a prerequisite for many other courses.

# What is Linear
- linearity = additivity + homogeneity

1. additivity
  f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)
2. homogeneity
  f(ax) = af(x)

- more properties will be introduced later(chapter 4  Linear Spaces)

- In this cource, we will mostly focus on linear spaces and linear transformations.
