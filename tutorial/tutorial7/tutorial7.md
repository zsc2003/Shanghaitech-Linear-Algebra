# the dimension of a vector space
(defined in last tutorial)
$V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, $S=\{\mathbf{v}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{v}_r\}$ is a subset of $V$
If
- $S$ is linearly independent
- $V=span(S)$

then we call $S$ a basis of $V$
the number of vectors in $S$ is the dimension of $V$, denoted as $dim(V)$
