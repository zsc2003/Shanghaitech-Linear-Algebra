- $P_n$ 所有次数$\leq n$的多项式的集合
  $P_n=\{p(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n:a_1,\cdots,a_n\in\mathbb{R}\}$

# the dimension of a vector space
(defined in last tutorial)
$V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, $S=\{\mathbf{v}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{v}_r\}$ is a subset of $V$
If
- $S$ is linearly independent
- $V=span(S)$

then we call $S$ a basis of $V$
the number of vectors in $S$ is the dimension of $V$, denoted as $dim(V)$
